Jonathan Shine, he sees the bug before you

Tim Jungmann, his javascript is readable like a charm

Norman Metz, he his calming you down when you're completely lost in the code

the main technologies we used were :

react native nodejs express

we used react-native because we really wanted to build a mobile app

one of the challenge was

to code the right algorithm for the splitting cost calculation.With the support of the teachers, day after day, thinking and rethinking, the architecture of the app progressed.

We learned a lot about team communication, discovered tech related content but last but not least we didn't forget to have fun.

But now let‘s hand over to Jo, having a look to the mobile app & check the functionalities”

challengies: find the right algorithm for the splitting calculations

learned : not forget to have fun
