but who are the minds behind that ? ↓↓↓

Jonathan Shine, he sees the bug before you

Tim Jungmann, his javascript is readable like a charm

Norman Metz, he his calming you down when you're completely lost in the code →→→

the main technologies we used :

react-native nodejs expressjs mongodb

we used react-native because we really wanted to build a mobile app.
React native was the way to go and yeaaaah what we wanted discover →→→

one of the challenges was
to code the right algorithm for the splitting cost.

We learned a lot about team communication, discovered tech related content but
last but not least we didn't forget to have fun. ↓↓↓

What we plan to do further in the future :

implementing the pushing notifications feature.

We would researching first & then break down the task building the functionality step by step.
